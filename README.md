# Othello-Game

Othello is a well-known two-player strategy game. It is played on an 8 x 8 board with 64 discs, black on one side and white on the other. One player plays discs black side up, the other white side up. In this game, the players have to overtake enemy pieces by bordering them between their own discs and then flipping the opponentâ€™s disc. A player must always place a disc on the board so that it flanks at least one disc of the opponent's colour. If a player cannot make a legal move, he or she must pass the turn. The winner is the one with the most discs on the board at the end of the game.

The game is built using AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API in Java and the swing package for GUI.

Netbeans IDE was used for the development of the project.
